# personal-website-template

This is a template for a personal website with a desktop and mobile menu

## Create a template of this as a new repo

Note it is assumed the user already has git and node package manager installed

Create a template of this Repo and call it username.github.io where username is your github username

Clone the repo to your local PC

Checkout develop

Open angular.json and do a find and replace for username.github.io

Run `npm install`

Run `ng deploy`

Open your git repo at https://github.com/username/username.github.io.git

You should see a new branch called gh-pages. Create a Pull Request and merge that branch back into master

You can now go to username.github.io and see your website

## Development server

When making changes locally you can run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
